## Games Academy Computer Advice ##

**Last updated on 29-05-2025**

We anticipate that you may wish to purchase a new computer to see you through your time at Falmouth University. This page will be updated to reflect our current buying advice for students enrolling on our undergraduate courses who wish to purchase a personal computer. 

Depending on your needs you may prefer a desktop or a laptop. We often find our students prefer a laptop due to the portability. Although laptops tend to be more expensive, they do not need additional peripherals.

Although we have facilities with up to spec PCs available on campus, having a personal computer can be helpful for work done from home or when facilities are in high demand.
We have separated our computer recommendations by course, which you will find below.

In the following document we provide a rough recommended specification and price range, as well as a list of recommended retailers. The parts recommendations we provide take into account latest gen hardware to ensure the longevity of the system you build. However, it is worth noting that looking at older gen hardware can be an easy way to keep costs down without a huge decrease in performance. 

# Recommended retailers #
You can purchase complete systems or parts from retailers. The websites below are recommendations from us for buying parts as traditionally building a pc from scratch is much cheaper than buying a prebuilt system.

We highly recommend students purchase an external solid state drive for transferring the large video content that you will be working with on the course. Here are two recommendations. 

* [Crucial X9 - 1TB](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Crucial-Portable-External-USB-Adapter/dp/B0CJK6RJG3?th=1) 
* [Crucial X9 - 2TB]([https://www.amazon.co.uk/Crucial-CT2000X6SSD9-X6-Portable-SSD/dp/B08FSNKNSV/](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Crucial-Portable-External-USB-Adapter/dp/B0CJK6PL7X?th=1))
