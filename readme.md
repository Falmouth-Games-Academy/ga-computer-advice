## Games Academy Computer Advice ##

We anticipate that you may wish to purchase a new computer to see you through your time at Falmouth University. Please be aware due to a shortage of semiconductors, GPUs are in short supply, and this has massively affected computer pricing. This page will be updated to reflect our current buying advice for students enrolling on our undergraduate courses who wish to purchase a personal computer. 

### So please take into account that the prices for these specs may vary **A LOT!!**

We have separated our computer recommendations by course, which you will find below.

We have also provided links to some pre-build PC's as this is one method of avoiding aditional costs due to the semiconductor shortage. The specs of these machines is generally what we would recommend for a PC and you are welcome to find the parts individually.
