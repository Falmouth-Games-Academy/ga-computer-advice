## Games Academy Computer Advice ##

**Last updated on 04-06-2024**

We anticipate that you may wish to purchase a new computer to see you through your time at Falmouth University. This page will be updated to reflect our current buying advice for students enrolling on our undergraduate courses who wish to purchase a personal computer. 

Depending on your needs you may prefer a desktop or a laptop. We often find our students prefer a laptop due to the portability. Although laptops tend to be more expensive, they do not need additional peripherals.

Although we have facilities with up to spec PCs available on campus, having a personal computer can be helpful for work done from home or when facilities are in high demand.
We have separated our computer recommendations by course, which you will find below.
