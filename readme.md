## Games Academy Computer Advice ##

**Last updated on 21-06-2022**

We anticipate that you may wish to purchase a new computer to see you through your time at Falmouth University. Although there was a shortage on GPUs in the last couple of years, this seems to be levelling out and prices are starting to come down again. This page will be updated to reflect our current buying advice for students enrolling on our undergraduate courses who wish to purchase a personal computer. 

### So please take into account that the prices for these specs may vary **A LOT!!**

We have separated our computer recommendations by course, which you will find below.

We have provided links to some pre-built PCs. The specs of these machines are generally what we would recommend for a PC and you are welcome to find the parts individually, or look at alternative pre-build retailers.
